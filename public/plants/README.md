Drop your plant stage images in this folder using these exact names:

1. `plant-stage-1.png` - seedling
2. `plant-stage-2.png` - sprout
3. `plant-stage-3.png` - leafy
4. `plant-stage-4.png` - blooming
5. `plant-stage-5.png` - thriving
6. `plant-stage-6.png` - flowering (used at top stage when fully watered)

The app reads these files at runtime and falls back to the built-in SVG if any image is missing.
